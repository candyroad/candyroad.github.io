                  <p>
                  This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.

                  <p><u>Third Party Advertising</u></p>
                  <p>Advertisements from third party ad networks may be displayed in our Games from time to time. All reasonable endeavours are used to ensure that these ad networks comply with the Act, the US Act, and COPPA in the provision of their services towards us.
                  If you click on any advertisements through Our game, the advertisers may use cookies and other web-tracking technologies to collect data. Some of this may be personal information, and some of it non-personal information.

                  Though We do not use cookies in order to track your movement around the web, Our websites (http://www.roadkill.co and http://www.candyroad.co) use Google Analytics to help analyse how users use these sites.

                  <p><u>California Online Privacy Protection Act</u></p>

                  <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p></p>
          </br>
                  <p><u>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</u></p>

                  <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>

                  <p>Our products and our website are not aimed at children under 13 years of age. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected information from a person under the age of 13, please contact us at the email address below and the information will be permanently deleted.</p>
          </br>
                  <p><u>Policy Updates</u></p>
                  <p>This policy may change from time to time. The most current version of our privacy policy can be found at http://candyroad.co/privacy. We will always keep this up to date so that you know what information we will collect from you, how we may use it, and when we may disclose it.</p>
